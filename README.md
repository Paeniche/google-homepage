What I learned.  
To get stuff exactly as I want is tricky and feels like I am fudging it most of the time by changing small variables to match the look of the Google homepage. If I were to build my own website I would try to make it more dynamic and us different tricks than I did to get the site to look the way it did.   
Overall it was interesting and I spent way too much time creating the hover affect for the search box.
